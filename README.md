This program automatically saves your Spotify-generated "Discover Weekly" playlist, which updates every week, to a "Saved Weekly" playlist. If the "Saved Weekly" playlist does not already exist
the program will create a new playlist and entitle it accordingly. I am currently working to learn how to automate this program to run weekly, which will allow me to never lose any recommended 
songs that I may have missed out on by forgetting to listen to my "Discover Weekly" playlist for a week.

Writing this program taught me how to use the Spotify API and gave me experience with using Flask. I also learned a lot about user authorization, which I found to be very interesting. This 
program ultimately provided me a stepping stone to write more Spotify-based programs in the future and gave me valuable experience in working with APIs.
